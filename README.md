### Mateush, here.

I’m a jack of all trades and master of none — but I kinda like learning and trying new things.

* I know Python, a bit.
* I know JavaScript, a bit.
* I know Java, a tiny bit.
* I know vim, a tiny bit.
* Did one project in Rust, and it’s pretty cool. 
* Also, I know AWS. A bit... but I wouldn’t say that I love it.

Few facts:
* I am based in Dubai but I’m a digital nomad, kinda.
* I hate commuting, but I’ve got a good remote job, and that makes me happy.
* I created an online course on building the [2048 game in React & Next.js](https://assets.mateu.sh/r/github-mateuszsokola-profile) that nobody is watching.

PS. Sometimes, I write tutorials and record screencasts. Whenever I do, I publish the code here.
